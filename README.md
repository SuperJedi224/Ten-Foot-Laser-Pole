# Ten Foot Laser Pole

Ten Foot Laser Pole is a java class library I have been working on for some time. It is a direct successor to a previously unnamed library which can be found [here.](https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/123874/)

The root package for the library is `sj224.tflp`.

It currently contains the following classes:

```
sj224.tflp.dice.Die
sj224.tflp.dice.Dice
sj224.tflp.dice.DieRoller
sj224.tflp.dice.ExplodingDie
sj224.tflp.dice.FudgeDie
sj224.tflp.math.Math
sj224.tflp.math.Complex
sj224.tflp.math.BigRational
sj224.tflp.util.ArrayUtil
sj224.tflp.util.BloomFilter
sj224.tflp.util.Pair
sj224.tflp.util.PopupGui
sj224.tflp.util.StringUtil
sj224.tflp.util.WeightedRandom
sj224.tflp.util.workflow.Workflow
sj224.tflp.util.event.Event
sj224.tflp.util.event.EventBus
sj224.tflp.util.event.EventPriority
```

The name is a reference to [this Darths and Droids strip.](http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0001.html)
